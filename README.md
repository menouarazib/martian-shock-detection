# Martian Bow Shock Detection
Automatic Detection of Martian bow shock crossings using data of the Mars Express mission: A Deep Learning Approach

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This repository contains a python script (run_predictions_orchestra.py) which should be executed in 
a virtual environment in order to make prediction of Martian Bow Shock crossings associated with a given start and stop times.
<h2>How this work ?</h2>
To do predictions you need to follow these steps:
👏
<ul>
    <li>activate the virtual environment = venv\Scripts\activate</li>
    <li>install the requirements = pip --no-cache-dir install -r path/../requirements.txt</li>
    <li>run the script with the following arguments a path to store results, a start time <strong>start</strong>, a stop time <strong>stop</strong> and a destination folder <strong>path</strong> =>
    <strong> python -m run_predictions_orchestra path start stop</strong>
    </li>
</ul>



 👏
